### Weekly Recap 

Kudos to eMOLT fisherman Joe Barrows (F/V Ryan Joseph) for agreeing to help 4-5 schools get their drifters in the water in the next few weeks.
Joe is ideally fishes in Mass Bay so that these units have some chance of heading south towards Cape Cod Bay, an area of interest as of late.

#### Doppio Bottom Temperature Forecast

Doppio bottom temperature forecasts over the last month have been pretty close to observations in Southern Maine, on the South Shore of Massachusetts, and east of New Jersey. Observations were warmer than forecasts around Plymouth, MA, and along the continental shelf south of Massachusetts. Observations were cooler than forecasts Downeast, outside of Provincetown, and south of Long Island. It will be interesting to see if additional data points Downeast help improve the forecast in that area as the year progresses.
