### Weekly Recap 
Kudos to a couple of eMOLT fishermen who have agreed to help us out with educational efforts this past week.  Joe Barrows (F/V Ryan Joseph out of Cohasset) agreed to get classroom-built drifters from 4-5 Boston-area schools in the water in the coming month. Joe fishes in Mass Bay so, ideally, these units have some chance of documenting Boston Harbor outflow towards Cape Cod Bay, always a interesting track. Dave Casoni (F/V Margaret M out of Sandwich) has agreed to come into the 3rd grade classroom in Dorchester with traps and live lobsters. There is no one better than Dave, a former school teacher, at this activity. This will be one class these third graders will not forget.

#### Doppio Bottom Temperature Forecast

Doppio bottom temperature forecasts over the last month have been pretty close to observations in Southern Maine, on the South Shore of Massachusetts, and east of New Jersey. Observations were warmer than forecasts around Plymouth, MA, and along the continental shelf south of Massachusetts. Observations were cooler than forecasts Downeast, outside of Provincetown, and south of Long Island. It will be interesting to see if additional data points Downeast help improve the forecast in that area as the year progresses.
