### Weekly Recap 
More than a dozen drifters have been deployed in the past month as seen below and updated routinely at [studentdrifters.org/track/drift_X.html](https://studentdrifters.org/track/drift_X.html). Kudos to the eMOLT fishermen who have  helped us out with these educational efforts.  Joe Barrows (F/V Ryan Joseph out of Cohasset) started deploying a few classroom-built drifters this past weekend and plans to deploy a few more from Boston area schools in the coming weeks. Joe fishes in Mass Bay so, ideally, these units have some chance of documenting Boston Harbor outflow towards Cape Cod Bay, always an interesting track.  Dave Casoni (F/V Margaret M out of Sandwich) came into a 3rd grade Dorchester classroom (where one of the drifters was being built) with traps and live lobsters a few weeks ago. That will be one class these third graders will not forget!
